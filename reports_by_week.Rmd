Below is a graph of the weekly number of adverse events for each drug. Beware! The graph below has a log-scale y-axis, this compresses large numbers and expands small numbers. Logging a scale reduces the visual appearance of outliers, but can also magnify trends. Consider the following questions.

-  Are the events falling or rising? This might indicate that the drug is becoming more or less popular.
-  Was the drug recently released?
-  Do you notice any patterns in the weekly number of reports?
