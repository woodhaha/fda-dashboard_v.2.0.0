**Welcome!** to FDA FAERS dashboard. It helps to make important drug reaction data accessible to the public and scientist.


<i>NOTE :</i> This dashboard doesn't contain counts of doses for each drug, so it's not possible with this data to understand the relative risks of drugs presented here. However, it is possible to look at distribution of outcomes of adverse events, see how many people are affected by adverse drugs and the ways they're affected.

<i>Note: the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070461.htm">reports 117,752 deaths in the database in just 2013</a>, so the number above [may even understate the total number of deaths from advese events](https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=&count=patient.reaction.reactionoutcome).</i>
