from adverse events related to medicine listed in the API, so I hope you'll agree that public awareness and understanding of the risks associated with pharmaceuticals are a worthy endeavor.

<i>Note: the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070461.htm">reports 117,752 deaths in the database in just 2013</a>, so the number above [may even understate the total number of deaths from advese events](https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=&count=patient.reaction.reactionoutcome).</i>

### Limitations

-  The actual reports are not very standardized, erroneous data are common.
-  Reports commonly list multiple drugs and multiple reactions, so there is not way to know if a certain drug caused a certain reaction. Here's a highly simplified example of [how reports are filled out](https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/#adverse-event-reports).
-  The data typically lag by six months, so this isn't recent data.
-  There's no measure of drugs dispensed, so actual counts reflect some mix of how common a drug is and how often reports are filed.
-  This dataset is limited to events that are actually reported, some drugs might be systematically reported more or less often.

### FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)

The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/">FDA FAERS system</a> is a database of adverse events (basically, drug reactions and medication error reports). The FDA uses the database in its post-marketing surveillance program.

### OpenFDA

In early 2014, <a href="https://open.fda.gov/update/introducing-openfda/">the FDA released an API</a> to make adverse event reports, labels, and eforcement reports more accessible.

Previously, these files only existed <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm">as flat files on the FDA website.</a> If you'd like to access the entirety of the data shown in this dashboard, these files are a good start -- though they generally lag by six months (today (6/27/15), the latest available data is from 2014).
